  ## Overview
  This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Node.js, Express for the backend, React with Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and MySQL for the database. The application allows users to perform basic operations on a MySQL database through a user-friendly interface.

   ## Tech Stack  

  **Client:** React, Redux, TailwindCSS  

  **Server:** Node, Express

  ## Structure  
  The project is organized into two main folders:

  - server: Contains the backend code using Node.js and Express. It handles API requests, interacts with the MySQL database, and serves the data to the frontend.
  - client: Contains the frontend code using React and Tailwind CSS. It provides the user interface and interacts with the backend to display data and perform CRUD operations.
      
  ## Usage ‚ú® 
  To run the app locally, follow these steps: 
  ### 1. Connect to MySQL Database 
  Before running the application, ensure that MySQL is installed and running on your machine. Create a database for the application. Edit the `database.js` file in the `server` folder to include your MySQL credentials and database details.

  ### 2. Install Dependencies
  Navigate to the `server` and `client` directories separately and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

  ### 3. Run the Application
  To start the backend server, navigate to the server directory and run:
  ```bash
  npm start 
  ```

  To start the frontend React application, navigate to the client directory and run:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  The backend will be running on http://localhost:5000 (or the port specified in your server configuration), and the React application will be running on http://localhost:5173 (or the port specified in your React configuration).
